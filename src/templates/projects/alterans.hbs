              My task was to create the visual identity of a brand from scratch, elaborate on the solution based on my experience and the clientâ€™s vision.
              I was supposed to design a logo, business cards and a website.

            <ul class="padding-top text-left">
              <li>
                The logo was supposed to be associated with some stellar & futuristic motives, yet - clearly communicate the connection with the technology. Despite its detailed construction - the sign still seems to be minimalistic and presents well on smaller formats.
              </li>
              <li>
                The client already had the preferred color palette on his mind - I used the white and navy blue for branding and added some more vivid blue color detail on the website for the icons/buttons/links & other UI elements.
              </li>
              <li>The website has a clear structure and lets the potential clients find all the information they need</li>
              <li>By using a simple visual communication (font, color palette, clean UI solutions) the brand brings to mind reliability and trust</li>
            </ul>
