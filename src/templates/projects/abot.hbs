            The challenge was to design a modern, clean & minimalistic landing page that will encourage more users to
            download the app and build the impression of trust and professionalism. Besides the main page, I was also
            supposed to prepare the mockups for Pricing, Testimonials, FAQ, and Terms & Conditions pages.
